# Python Indentation
In python indentation refers to the space at the beginning of a code line.
In other programming languages the indentation used for readability of a code but coming to python indentation it is very important.
Indentation indicates the block of code in python. if we skip the indentation it will gives you a error and we have to use the same number of spaces in a same block of code otherwise it will gives errors

# Python Comments
comments are used in to code for easy to understand and the code and for readability
- *For creating the comment we use '#' symbol*

           #Ex: #This is a comment 

"when we use '#' symbol at the starting of the sentence or code the it does not execute that statements and we can use multiple comments by using '#' symbol at the starting of the statements."
- *for multiline comments we can also use triple quotation*
           
           # Ex: """
                  This is a comment
                  about triple quotations
                  and the code
                  """
