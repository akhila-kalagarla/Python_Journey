'''ABSTRACTION - Displaying only essential features and hiding unnecessary details
Definition: Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that focuses on exposing only the necessary parts of an object while hiding the complex implementation details. 
This allows users to interact with objects at a higher level without needing to understand the underlying complexities.'''
#Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation:
'''Abstraction is about hiding the complexity by providing a simplified interface, 
while encapsulation is about bundling the data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class).'''
