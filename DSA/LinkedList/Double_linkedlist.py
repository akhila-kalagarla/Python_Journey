''' Double linked list - A linked list in which each node contains a reference (link) to the next node as well as to the previous node. 
This allows for traversal in both directions (forward and backward) through the list.
This is in contrast to a singly linked list, where each node only contains a reference to the next node, allowing for traversal in only one direction.
